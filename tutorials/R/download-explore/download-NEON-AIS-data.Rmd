This tutorial covers downloading NEON aquatic instrument system (AIS) data, using the 
neonUtilities R package, as well as basic instruction in beginning to 
explore and work with the downloaded data, including guidance in 
navigating data documentation and understanding how to seperate data using the 
horizontal (HOR) variable.

## Objectives

After completing this activity, you will be able to:

* Download NEON AIS data using the neonUtilities package.
* Understand downloaded data sets and load them into R for analyses.

## Things Youâ€™ll Need To Complete This Tutorial
To complete this tutorial you will need the most current version of R and, 
preferably, RStudio loaded on your computer.

### Install R Packages

* **neonUtilities**: Basic functions for accessing NEON data

Some of these packages are on CRAN and can be installed by 
`install.packages()`, others need to be installed from 
other repositories:

```{r packages, eval=FALSE}

install.packages("devtools")
install.packages("neonUtilities")
install.packages("raster")
devtools::install_github("NEONScience/NEON-geolocation/geoNEON")
install.packages("BiocManager")
BiocManager::install("rhdf5")

```
